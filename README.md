# Amaterasu
Amaterasu is a discord moderation bot written in Scala using JDA. It is named after the [Naruto Jutsu](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Amaterasu) however, there is no cool artwork of that, so I pretend its named after that Japanese sun goddess.

## What Amaterasu does
- Handle bans, kicks, mutes and other moderation actions.
- Provides helpful commands to help simplify the process of moderating a discord server.

## What Amaterasu does not do
- **Play music.** Discord has spotify built in, but if for some reason your guild still thinks its cool to play music at 64kbps in a voice channel while people are talking, there are a million other bots for that.
- **Provide fun commands.** Your members can get married in roblox.

## Usage
Even though this code is open sourced I put a lot of time an effort into it and I would hate if my project was blatantly ripped or reused without crediting me. If for some reason you decide to reuse my horrible code please do not claim it as your own work.
